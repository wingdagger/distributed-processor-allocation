- Read kali paper.  How does kali pass threads (or any object) across
the network?)  Learn everything about kali.

- Check UNIX thread library for "thread loads."  If there is not such
a thing, check other sources, and then invent one for kali for use in
my ds.

- Find source for "top" or "w" (w -u), in order to get load from the
system.

- Does kali talk between daemons or through the first command
interpreter?  How does kali do communications?  Can I pass messages
from daemon to daemon without going theoruhg a centralized mailbox
system?  In other words, can I distibuted mailboxes?

- Compare old results with new results.  Is a pure simulation giving
realistic results?  If not, how can I modify the simulated
environment.  There are 3 levels of comparison: simulation,
quasi-simulation, and the real thing.

- Research the web, etc. for DS and DS processor allocation.  Look for
Tanenbaum, Universities that do DS research, etc.

- Gather collection of materials on DS.  Acutally READ!!!

- What are other approaches that could be better or should be
considered and why?

- What characteristics does B have that make it better than C.  Other
than the numbers, why is this?  From a theory POV?

- Need a committee of 3 in Sept.
