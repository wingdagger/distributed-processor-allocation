- For the centralized algorithm, I need to subtract out the initial load
from all of the load averages in the final statistics.  This is
because my system assumes all job requests go through it; however, for
the full implementation, initial system loads already exists becuase
not all job requests go through it.  Also, I need to run on machines
that are not being used by other peopel to get best
results. Otherwise, some other person could affect the real load
average and not go trhough my centralized algorithm.
